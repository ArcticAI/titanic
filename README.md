# Titanic's Shipwreck Survival Prediction
In this notebook we tried to predict if someone survived to the shipwreck having other features like the age, ticket fare, cabin, family size aboard, sex...

Correlation between the numeric features:\

Survival rate by age group:\

Survival rate by family size:\

We used different models for the prediction and validate them with a 10k-fold CV:\
